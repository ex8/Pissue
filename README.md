# Pissue
A very small issue tracking app built using Angular 7 and Express 4 along with MongoDB as the data store and Material UI for the frontend components. 

### Technologies used
- Node.js
- Express.js (backend web framework)
- Angular 7 (frontend web framework)
- Angular Material (UI components)
- MongoDB (document database)

### Usage
You must run both the backend and frontend instances. For the backend you can run `npm run dev` to start the Express server. To fire up the frontend you must run `ng serve`.
